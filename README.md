## Description<a id='description'></a>
This repository contains a back end for a social network.  A MongoDB database was created using Mongoose for the models and controllers.  There are User and Thought models, and a Reaction schema exists within the Thought model.  Routes are built using Express.  


## Installation<a id='installation'></a>
Run 'npm i' from the console to install dependencies.  

## Usage Information<a id='usageInfo'></a>
Run 'npm start' to begin the server.  There is no front end - use Insomnia to test the routes and create/read/update/delete data.  For example, create a POST request at https://localhost:3001/api/users to create a user, with a JSON body including username and email.
